# Advanced-ML

Welcome to Advanced-ML, a repository showcasing advanced machine learning models developed on 2 datasets. This repository includes implementations of three different models: Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Neural Network, each trained and evaluated on different datasets for classification and/or regression tasks.

## Models Implemented

- [Neural Network](./NN)
- [Support Vector Machine](./SVM)
- [Decision Tree](./Decision%20Tree)
